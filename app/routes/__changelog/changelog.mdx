#### Changed

- Renamed the title from 'Changelog | Muthukumar' -> 'Changelog | Nullish.in'. It doesn't make sense to have Muthukumar to the changelog.
- In index route, changed the title('Blog | Muthukumar' => 'Muthukumar').
- Update robots.txt content
  ```txt
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  ```
- Moved the `robots.txt` file from resource routes to public folder.

  ```txt
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /

  Sitemap: https://nullish.in/sitemap.xml
  ```

- Changed `Read more` in the blog to `Continue reading`. Read more seems vague and generic. Continue Reading seems okay than Read more.
- Upgraded to remix FORM for the blog post search

#### Removed

- Removed duplicate viewport tag.
- Removed robots header from the meta. All the robots stuff are moved to the robots.txt file/route.

```

```
